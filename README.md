A kind of artificial intelligence is machine learning. Its heart is algorithmic procedures, 
which allow the machine to solve issues without the need for specialist computer programming. 
The widespread use of ML in the medical industry promotes medical innovation, lowers medical 
expenses, and improves medical quality. Chronic Kidney Disease refers to the kidneys' inability 
to fulfill their normal blood filtration role and other functions. The term "chronic" refers to the 
progressive deterioration of kidney cells over time. Chronic kidney disease is a significant public 
health problem worldwide, especially for low and medium income countries. Chronic kidney 
disease means that the kidney does not work as expected and cannot correctly filter blood. About 
10% of the population worldwide suffers from Chronic kidney disease, and millions die each 
year because they cannot get affordable treatment, with the number increasing in the elderly. 
This is a severe renal failure in which the kidney no longer filters blood and there is a significant 
fluid accumulation in the body. This causes an abnormally high level of potassium and calcium 
salts in the body. High quantities of these salts in the body cause a variety of additional 
problems. 
The primary function of the kidneys is to filter excess water and wastes from the blood. 
This mechanism must work properly to balance the salts and minerals in our bodies. The proper 
salt balance is required to manage blood pressure, activate hormones, and create red blood cells, 
among other things. A high calcium concentration causes bone problems and cystic ovaries in 
women. Chronic Kidney Disease can also cause a sudden sickness or an allergy to specific 
medications. Acute is the medical term for this condition. To raise awareness and to encourage 
those who are most susceptible to the disease to perform the tests periodically, the disease can be 
detected with the least possible tests and at low cost. So, the objective of this research is to 
provide an effective model to predict the Chronic kidney disease by least number of predictors.
